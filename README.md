# Enhanced Location Filtering Feature

## Overview

The Profile Filtering Agent now includes flexible location filtering that allows users to:

1. **Default EU Coverage**: Automatically searches across all EU countries
2. **Additional Countries**: Optionally add more countries to expand the search
3. **Smart Validation**: Validates country names against a comprehensive list
4. **Visual Feedback**: Shows which countries will be included in the search

## How It Works

### Default Behavior

- By default, the system searches for speakers from EU countries
- The event location is automatically included if specified
- Special handling for major markets (USA, China)

### Adding Additional Countries

Users can expand the search by:

1. Entering additional country names in the "Additional Countries" field
2. Separating multiple countries with commas
3. The system validates each country name
4. Invalid country names are highlighted and ignored

### Examples

**Event in UK, no additional countries:**

- Searches: EU countries + UK

**Event in UK, additional countries: "Japan, Brazil":**

- Searches: EU countries + UK + Japan + Brazil

**Event in USA:**

- Searches: EU countries + USA + China (automatic)

## Implementation Details

### Components Updated

1. `location_filter.py` - Core filtering logic enhanced
2. `main.py` - UI components and validation added
3. `filtering.py` - Pipeline updated to pass additional countries

### Key Features

- **Input Validation**: Uses the `valid_countries` constant for validation
- **Smart Defaults**: EU countries included by default
- **Flexible Addition**: Easy to add more countries
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication of what will be searched
- **Error Handling**: Invalid countries are flagged but don't break the process

## Usage Tips

1. **Leave additional countries empty** for EU + event location only
2. **Use proper country names** like "United Kingdom", "United States", "South Korea"
3. **Check the summary** in the expandable section to see all countries
4. **Multiple countries**: Separate with commas: "Japan, Brazil, Australia"

## Technical Notes

- The filtering is case-insensitive
- Partial matches are supported (e.g., "germany" matches profiles with "Berlin, Germany")
- Event location is automatically included in search criteria
- The system maintains backward compatibility with existing functionality
