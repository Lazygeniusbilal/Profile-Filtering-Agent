My journey started in a TV production house, where I honed my skills in visual storytelling and creative direction before transitioning into product design within the telecom industry. This evolution gave me a unique perspective—blending art direction, structured design systems, and digital experience innovation to create scalable, high-impact UI solutions.

As a Senior Product Designer specializing in Art Direction & Systems Thinking, I focus on transforming complex enterprise and customer-facing digital experiences into intuitive, visually compelling interfaces. At Vodafone, I work across multiple markets, ensuring design consistency, brand alignment, and streamlined collaboration between design and development teams.

🔹 Key Achievements & Impact:

✅ Led a system transformation, streamlining workflows for team of designers improving efficiency by 35%.
✅ Designed enterprise and customer-facing UI solutions, now implemented in 5+ Vodafone markets, enhancing user experience consistency.
✅ Developed scalable frameworks to improve design-development collaboration
✅ Advocated for and expanded design system adoption, reducing redundant design efforts by 30% across platforms.
✅ Ensured UI consistency & brand alignment across 20+ Vodafone platforms, improving brand compliance rates by 25%.

🔹 Expertise & Tools:

I leverage a robust toolkit—Figma, Adobe Creative Suite, Sketch, and Cinema 4D—to create high-fidelity prototypes, motion-based interactions, and visually cohesive design systems. Additionally, I’m a Certified Usability Analyst (CUA) by Human Factors International, with credentials in Design Thinking & Scrum Foundations, allowing me to blend creativity with structured problem-solving.

I enjoy connecting with creatives and discussing ideas and experiences within their organizations, believing in the power of learning, sharing, and evolving new ideas to drive impactful design solutions.

Beyond work, I find inspiration in doodling, hiking, trekking, and playing the ukulele, which fuel my creativity and help me bring fresh perspectives to design challenges.

Joining bp in 2013 in Singapore as the head of hr for shipping eastern hemisphere, he also had the opportunity to lead change management for its global HR transformation programme and moved to London in 2017. He currently is the HR leader for one of bp's businesses in its gas & low carbon energy entity. Prior to this current role, he supported bp's upstream finance & the global procurement organisations. He was the HR lead for group procurement design and is also one of the global facilitators for Purposeful Connections as part of reinventing bp, its global transformation programme. 

Over the course of his international career of more than 20 years, Miles has held a wide range of HR leadership roles working across many operating sites and business units in Procter & Gamble (PG) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) in Asia Pacific. He has lived and worked in the Philippines, Indonesia, Singapore and is currently based in London. 

Miles comes from the Philippines where energy supply and distribution continue to be erratic and expensive particularly in areas outside urban areas and that is why Miles finds bp’s new purpose inspiring and personally meaningful. He is truly excited about reinventing bp and reimagining energy in co-creating a global organisation that is integrated, nimble, empowered and capable to meet current and future business and customer needs providing cleaner energy that is accessible, available and affordable for all.  He is also excited about bp's continuous commitment of being a truly inclusive and motivating workplace where people can contribute and at the same time develop their fullest potential. In 2019, he joined Global Reach UK in bp - a business resource group (BRG) as a member and is now a co-chair since January 2021, providing opportunities to build members’ cultural fluency through networking, practical support and promoting inclusion to support bp's Diversity, Equity & Inclusion commitments. 

Outside work, Miles spends his time learning how to cook all-time favourite Filipino dishes for his wife and two sons, playing tennis, connecting with family and friends, and continues to support rehabilitation, reconstruction & recovery efforts in various towns and cities in his home country, the Philippines.",,Oil and Gas,"london, england, united kingdom","London Area, United Kingdom",4 years 8 months in role,11 years 10 months in company,BP,https://www.linkedin.com/company/1389,"Change Management Lead, HR Modernisation (Global HR transformation)",03/2017-01/2019,1 year 10 months,3rd,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D03AQHA3yWbyE_R-A/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1627022858970?e=1758758400&v=beta&t=PXAY7DUFmLyEMv3jiN-bSw3WNSWw0GYB9hA0buU_kdg,0,Miles Horca,ACwAAAKw3rkBF3YbMJ4RNWYkSRHqsZrLCaDyWoc,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACwAAAKw3rkBF3YbMJ4RNWYkSRHqsZrLCaDyWoc/,True,True,https://www.linkedin.com/sales/search/people?query=(spellCorrectionEnabled%3Atrue%2CrecentSearchParam%3A(id%3A3891166073%2CdoLogHistory%3Atrue)%2Cfilters%3AList((type%3ASENIORITY_LEVEL%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A120%2Ctext%3ASenior%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A220%2Ctext%3ADirector%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A300%2Ctext%3AVice%2520President%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3ACOMPANY_HEADCOUNT%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3AH%2Ctext%3A5001-10%252C000%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3AI%2Ctext%3A10%252C000%252B%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3AREGION%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A101165590%2Ctext%3AUnited%2520Kingdom%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A101282230%2Ctext%3AGermany%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A103350119%2Ctext%3AItaly%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3AYEARS_IN_CURRENT_POSITION%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A3%2Ctext%3A3%2520to%25205%2520years%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A4%2Ctext%3A6%2520to%252010%2520years%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A5%2Ctext%3AMore%2520than%252010%2520years%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3ACOMPANY_TYPE%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3AC%2Ctext%3APublic%2520Company%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3AP%2Ctext%3APrivately%2520Held%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3APROFILE_LANGUAGE%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3Aen%2Ctext%3AEnglish%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3AYEARS_OF_EXPERIENCE%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A5%2Ctext%3AMore%2520than%252010%2520years%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3AYEARS_AT_CURRENT_COMPANY%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A3%2Ctext%3A3%2520to%25205%2520years%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A4%2Ctext%3A6%2520to%252010%2520years%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A5%2Ctext%3AMore%2520than%252010%2520years%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED))))%2Ckeywords%3A%25E2%2580%259Ctransformation%25E2%2580%259D%2520AND%2520%25E2%2580%259Ccollaboration%25E2%2580%259D%2520AND%2520%2522innovation%2522)&sessionId=jTMWFDW0SXqvrn2MYcpFVA%3D%3D&viewAllFilters=true,2025-08-22T11:50:35.213Z,https://linkedin.com/in/miles-horca-04915213,609410745,Georgina Glas,Category B

With more than 20 years of experience in Supply Chain, I have held operational, consultancy, project (including transformation), and capability roles across Planning and Customer Service/Operations.

I thrive when I can challenge the status quo and there is space for creativity; or there is a complex problem,  with a data story to tell, because breaking it down into a simple narrative can influence, mobilise, and create such an impact.

And I have not doubt....I learn everyday.




While building expertise in these two areas, the pivotal moments in my career have been when I addressed tensions between teams and functions, with deep understanding of needs, conflicting priorities and win-win mentality. In such ecosystems we operate in, I bring balance by addressing complex problems, create data stories to support them, and decompose into simple narratives to influence and mobilise. I am continuously recognised as someone that breaks down that complexity, navigates strategy and tactics as needed, and feel equally comfortable leading topics that increase the digital blueprint (e.g. Machine Learning, Decision Automation, Data) or topics that focus on people (e.g. Change Leadership, Storytelling to Influence, Coaching).",,Manufacturing,"london, england, united kingdom","London Area, United Kingdom",5 years 1 month in role,16 years 2 months in company,Unilever,https://www.linkedin.com/company/1248,Planning Internal Consultant & Transformation Manager,01/2016-07/2020,4 years 6 months,2nd,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E03AQHcARHt6iGgmg/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1677585588272?e=1758758400&v=beta&t=89ZLtph256yTJxZO3TsWeWb3wavxHO9n5b1HQAHoLKs,0,Paulina Ferrer,ACwAABGHs8ABj0uwswzxaoisNoHy0iY9Xb6sSPQ,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACwAABGHs8ABj0uwswzxaoisNoHy0iY9Xb6sSPQ/,False,False,https://www.linkedin.com/sales/search/people?query=(spellCorrectionEnabled%3Atrue%2CrecentSearchParam%3A(id%3A3891166073%2CdoLogHistory%3Atrue)%2Cfilters%3AList((type%3ASENIORITY_LEVEL%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A120%2Ctext%3ASenior%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A220%2Ctext%3ADirector%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A300%2Ctext%3AVice%2520President%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3ACOMPANY_HEADCOUNT%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3AH%2Ctext%3A5001-10%252C000%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3AI%2Ctext%3A10%252C000%252B%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3AREGION%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A101165590%2Ctext%3AUnited%2520Kingdom%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A101282230%2Ctext%3AGermany%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A103350119%2Ctext%3AItaly%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3AYEARS_IN_CURRENT_POSITION%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A3%2Ctext%3A3%2520to%25205%2520years%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A4%2Ctext%3A6%2520to%252010%2520years%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A5%2Ctext%3AMore%2520than%252010%2520years%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3ACOMPANY_TYPE%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3AC%2Ctext%3APublic%2520Company%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3AP%2Ctext%3APrivately%2520Held%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3APROFILE_LANGUAGE%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3Aen%2Ctext%3AEnglish%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3AYEARS_OF_EXPERIENCE%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A5%2Ctext%3AMore%2520than%252010%2520years%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3AYEARS_AT_CURRENT_COMPANY%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A3%2Ctext%3A3%2520to%25205%2520years%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A4%2Ctext%3A6%2520to%252010%2520years%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A5%2Ctext%3AMore%2520than%252010%2520years%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED))))%2Ckeywords%3A%25E2%2580%259Ctransformation%25E2%2580%259D%2520AND%2520%25E2%2580%259Ccollaboration%25E2%2580%259D%2520AND%2520%2522innovation%2522)&sessionId=jTMWFDW0SXqvrn2MYcpFVA%3D%3D&viewAllFilters=true,2025-08-22T11:53:42.332Z,https://linkedin.com/in/paulina-ferrer-3145b482,609410745,Georgina Glas,Category A

My emphasis on coaching stems from a belief that clarity and communication are the pillars of success, developing and empowering teams to reach their full potential.
