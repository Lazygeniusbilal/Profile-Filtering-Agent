Rooted in the hospitality sector, my passion for serving customers drives me.

--------------------------------------------------

The Story - Why is customer-centricity one of my key strengths?

An Italian captain I once worked for on a six-star cruise line looked at me and said:

“Katrin, if a customer asks for a bowl of peeled grapes at 3 AM or a perfectly ironed newspaper, you don’t ask why. You polish the silver tray and you deliver.”

“That’s the difference between service and excellence.”

That moment stuck with me. I started to feel the difference between simply serving and truly delivering excellence.

Where did I learn this? My parents ran a hospitality business, so I grew up in the industry. It shaped how I see customer care and pushed me to refine my skills at Hotelschool The Hague, one of the world’s leading hospitality schools.

In five- and six-star hotels, my job was to make the impossible happen—turning last-minute requests into seamless experiences and ensuring every guest felt like the most important person in the room.

This mindset shaped my journey into innovation. At the DHL Innovation Center, I worked at the intersection of technology and societal trends, focusing on big data, IoT, robotics, and automation—always with the customer at the core.

Today, in a company with remarkable customers you can do nothing but fall in love with, I focus on driving impact through sustainability and waste reduction. I help customers turn regulatory challenges like PPWR into opportunities for business growth.

Beyond business, I am passionate about coaching and developing people, empowering teams, and supporting female leadership—because diverse perspectives fuel better decisions and long-term success.

And every day, I keep that Italian captain in the back of my mind…polish the silver tray, deliver excellence, and always put the customer first.",,"Transportation, Logistics, Supply Chain and Storage","addlestone, england, united kingdom","Cologne, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany",5 years 5 months in role,5 years 5 months in company,DHL,https://www.linkedin.com/company/1355,Program Director Innovation Center Americas,06/2017-06/2019,2 years,2nd,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E03AQFnAxOJT2uBDA/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1723216048942?e=1758758400&v=beta&t=jrdx3Ugum_4RXRw6A4aWVySuYXjyPjIe3A0ef_St0xo,1,Katrin Zeiler,ACwAAAScwo4Bxf-Gi6x2hHpG8XNgDoGxtox_5qc,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACwAAAScwo4Bxf-Gi6x2hHpG8XNgDoGxtox_5qc/,False,False,https://www.linkedin.com/sales/search/people?query=(spellCorrectionEnabled%3Atrue%2CrecentSearchParam%3A(id%3A3891166073%2CdoLogHistory%3Atrue)%2Cfilters%3AList((type%3ASENIORITY_LEVEL%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A120%2Ctext%3ASenior%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A220%2Ctext%3ADirector%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A300%2Ctext%3AVice%2520President%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3ACOMPANY_HEADCOUNT%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3AH%2Ctext%3A5001-10%252C000%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3AI%2Ctext%3A10%252C000%252B%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3AREGION%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A101165590%2Ctext%3AUnited%2520Kingdom%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A101282230%2Ctext%3AGermany%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A103350119%2Ctext%3AItaly%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3AYEARS_IN_CURRENT_POSITION%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A3%2Ctext%3A3%2520to%25205%2520years%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A4%2Ctext%3A6%2520to%252010%2520years%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A5%2Ctext%3AMore%2520than%252010%2520years%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3ACOMPANY_TYPE%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3AC%2Ctext%3APublic%2520Company%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3AP%2Ctext%3APrivately%2520Held%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3APROFILE_LANGUAGE%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3Aen%2Ctext%3AEnglish%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3AYEARS_OF_EXPERIENCE%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A5%2Ctext%3AMore%2520than%252010%2520years%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3AYEARS_AT_CURRENT_COMPANY%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A3%2Ctext%3A3%2520to%25205%2520years%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A4%2Ctext%3A6%2520to%252010%2520years%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A5%2Ctext%3AMore%2520than%252010%2520years%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED))))%2Ckeywords%3A%25E2%2580%259Ctransformation%25E2%2580%259D%2520AND%2520%25E2%2580%259Ccollaboration%25E2%2580%259D%2520AND%2520%2522innovation%2522)&sessionId=jTMWFDW0SXqvrn2MYcpFVA%3D%3D&viewAllFilters=true,2025-08-22T11:27:12.889Z,https://linkedin.com/in/katrinzeiler,609410745,Georgina Glas,Category C,"This profile was selected for the event due to the candidate's extensive experience in driving complex collaboration projects and building stakeholder relationships, aligning with the event's focus on Building Intrapreneurial Capabilities and Business Transformation.

My journey started in a TV production house, where I honed my skills in visual storytelling and creative direction before transitioning into product design within the telecom industry. This evolution gave me a unique perspective—blending art direction, structured design systems, and digital experience innovation to create scalable, high-impact UI solutions.

As a Senior Product Designer specializing in Art Direction & Systems Thinking, I focus on transforming complex enterprise and customer-facing digital experiences into intuitive, visually compelling interfaces. At Vodafone, I work across multiple markets, ensuring design consistency, brand alignment, and streamlined collaboration between design and development teams.

🔹 Key Achievements & Impact:

✅ Led a system transformation, streamlining workflows for team of designers improving efficiency by 35%.
✅ Designed enterprise and customer-facing UI solutions, now implemented in 5+ Vodafone markets, enhancing user experience consistency.
✅ Developed scalable frameworks to improve design-development collaboration
✅ Advocated for and expanded design system adoption, reducing redundant design efforts by 30% across platforms.
✅ Ensured UI consistency & brand alignment across 20+ Vodafone platforms, improving brand compliance rates by 25%.

🔹 Expertise & Tools:

I leverage a robust toolkit—Figma, Adobe Creative Suite, Sketch, and Cinema 4D—to create high-fidelity prototypes, motion-based interactions, and visually cohesive design systems. Additionally, I’m a Certified Usability Analyst (CUA) by Human Factors International, with credentials in Design Thinking & Scrum Foundations, allowing me to blend creativity with structured problem-solving.

I enjoy connecting with creatives and discussing ideas and experiences within their organizations, believing in the power of learning, sharing, and evolving new ideas to drive impactful design solutions.

Beyond work, I find inspiration in doodling, hiking, trekking, and playing the ukulele, which fuel my creativity and help me bring fresh perspectives to design challenges.

In my experience: people, clarity, and trust.

Over 35 years in banking — across Human Resources, Corporate Real Estate, and Operations — I’ve focused on shaping environments that enable individuals and teams to work at their best.

🏢 At Banco BPM (formerly Banca Popolare di Milano), in 2013 I led one of Italy’s earliest shifts towards what became known as ""Smart Working"" — a flexible, trust-based work model.
We placed autonomy and accountability at the core — long before it became standard practice.

The initiative sparked a cultural transformation, aligning space, technology, organisational design, and leadership grounded in trust — not surveillance.
It engaged the whole company in rethinking how and where we work, using a methodical approach that fostered shared ownership.

The project gained recognition in research, media, and publications — including Harvard Business Review — and in 2017 received Italy’s Innovation Award under the patronage of President Mattarella.

👥 I’ve had the privilege to manage large teams and oversee complex budgets, always favouring a leadership style grounded in clarity and trust — not in slogans, but in showing up and doing the work.

📚 I’ve practised it since I was 18, when I studied the law and deliberately shaped my future — exempting myself from conscription. A turning point with lifelong impact.

🏛️ Today, I serve on my city council. It keeps me close to what matters: place, community, duty.

🥁 Music shaped how I lead. Years in a marching band taught me rhythm, discipline, and when to step back so others can step forward.

🎤 I draw energy from people who combine talent with purpose. Spanish singer Soraya Arnelas — known for her powerful voice and perseverance — is one of them. Her art reminds me of what it means to lead with intent.

💬 I also carry a quote from Professor Vittorio Coda:
“It is the heart that sets the mind in motion (è il cuore che attiva l’intelligenza).”
That’s leadership, in one sentence.

🧠 This is the mindset I bring to boards, teams, and communities.

🌍 Bilingual (English/Italian) | Dual citizenship (UK/IT) | Committed to transformation, innovation, and impact.

🚫 Just a note:
This is a personal profile. I value genuine interactions and professional engagement, not unsolicited commercial approaches. I don’t represent my company on LinkedIn, and I don’t share contacts or make referrals.

🤝 I believe in thoughtful dialogue and honest exchange, regardless of role, background, or stage in life.

25+ years shaping iconic brands through strategic creativity and purposeful storytelling

With over two decades of global creative experience, I’ve had the privilege of partnering with some of the world’s most respected brands to build distinctive identities, craft impactful communications, and forge lasting connections with customers. Whether working directly within brands or alongside agency teams, I focus on delivering value through insight-driven creative thinking and executional excellence.

Currently at Marks & Spencer, I lead the creative direction as the brand navigates a bold and exciting transformation. From evolving the visual identity to delivering insight-led campaigns, I ensure that every expression of the brand — across digital, in-store, and beyond — reflects its modern voice and ambition. I lead a multidisciplinary team to deliver fully integrated campaigns that are aligned across every touchpoint — ensuring consistency, cohesion, and customer impact at scale. Working cross-functionally with marketing, product, and commercial teams, I align creative vision with business goals to drive engagement, strengthen loyalty, and fuel commercial success.

I’m passionate about building long-term partnerships and providing clear, strategic creative leadership that enables brands to thrive in a constantly shifting landscape. From concept to execution, I champion creative excellence, foster collaboration, and push boundaries — ensuring every project connects meaningfully with its audience and delivers measurable impact.

I have developed a strong expertise in transforming policy into actionable strategies, guiding digital transformation, and implementing data-driven solutions to enhance service performance and user experience. My career is marked by successfully managing national-scale initiatives, collaborating with diverse stakeholder groups, and fostering innovation even under intense scrutiny and shifting priorities.

I excel in strategic leadership and programme management, utilising methodologies such as Agile and PRINCE2 to deliver large-scale projects on time and within budget. My ability to build trust and consensus among policymakers, technical teams, and external partners has been instrumental in achieving strategic objectives and driving continuous improvement. Additionally, I leverage analytics to optimise operations, measure impact, and inform decision-making, ensuring that initiatives not only meet immediate goals but also deliver long-term value.

Throughout my career, I have demonstrated a commitment to fostering cross-functional collaboration and managing complex change, enabling teams to navigate transitions smoothly and adopt new approaches effectively. My background in the NHS has equipped me with a deep understanding of large organisational dynamics, strategic planning, and the importance of sustainable, scalable solutions.

I am passionate about using my skills in strategic planning, digital innovation, and stakeholder engagement to make a meaningful impact, continuously striving to improve systems and processes for better outcomes.","As the National Directory of Services (DoS) Senior Manager for Urgent and Emergency Care, I lead the operational strategy, daily operations and policy relating to the DoS, ensuring it remains a cornerstone for efficient and effective patient pathways across the NHS. With a deep understanding of complex NHS business processes, I work at the intersection of technology, clinical priorities, and commissioning strategies, ensuring the DoS is fit for purpose and aligned with the evolving needs of health and social care systems.

In my role, I:
- Champion quality and accuracy of the DoS by collaborating with regional and local DoS leads, driving improvements that directly impact patient outcomes.
- Coordinate system-wide projects, bridging NHS Pathways, commissioners, system suppliers, and NHS111 providers to deliver seamless operational excellence.

Joining bp in 2013 in Singapore as the head of hr for shipping eastern hemisphere, he also had the opportunity to lead change management for its global HR transformation programme and moved to London in 2017. He currently is the HR leader for one of bp's businesses in its gas & low carbon energy entity. Prior to this current role, he supported bp's upstream finance & the global procurement organisations. He was the HR lead for group procurement design and is also one of the global facilitators for Purposeful Connections as part of reinventing bp, its global transformation programme. 

Over the course of his international career of more than 20 years, Miles has held a wide range of HR leadership roles working across many operating sites and business units in Procter & Gamble (PG) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) in Asia Pacific. He has lived and worked in the Philippines, Indonesia, Singapore and is currently based in London. 

Miles comes from the Philippines where energy supply and distribution continue to be erratic and expensive particularly in areas outside urban areas and that is why Miles finds bp’s new purpose inspiring and personally meaningful. He is truly excited about reinventing bp and reimagining energy in co-creating a global organisation that is integrated, nimble, empowered and capable to meet current and future business and customer needs providing cleaner energy that is accessible, available and affordable for all.  He is also excited about bp's continuous commitment of being a truly inclusive and motivating workplace where people can contribute and at the same time develop their fullest potential. In 2019, he joined Global Reach UK in bp - a business resource group (BRG) as a member and is now a co-chair since January 2021, providing opportunities to build members’ cultural fluency through networking, practical support and promoting inclusion to support bp's Diversity, Equity & Inclusion commitments. 

Outside work, Miles spends his time learning how to cook all-time favourite Filipino dishes for his wife and two sons, playing tennis, connecting with family and friends, and continues to support rehabilitation, reconstruction & recovery efforts in various towns and cities in his home country, the Philippines.",,Oil and Gas,"london, england, united kingdom","London Area, United Kingdom",4 years 8 months in role,11 years 10 months in company,BP,https://www.linkedin.com/company/1389,"Change Management Lead, HR Modernisation (Global HR transformation)",03/2017-01/2019,1 year 10 months,3rd,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C4D03AQHA3yWbyE_R-A/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1627022858970?e=1758758400&v=beta&t=PXAY7DUFmLyEMv3jiN-bSw3WNSWw0GYB9hA0buU_kdg,0,Miles Horca,ACwAAAKw3rkBF3YbMJ4RNWYkSRHqsZrLCaDyWoc,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACwAAAKw3rkBF3YbMJ4RNWYkSRHqsZrLCaDyWoc/,True,True,https://www.linkedin.com/sales/search/people?query=(spellCorrectionEnabled%3Atrue%2CrecentSearchParam%3A(id%3A3891166073%2CdoLogHistory%3Atrue)%2Cfilters%3AList((type%3ASENIORITY_LEVEL%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A120%2Ctext%3ASenior%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A220%2Ctext%3ADirector%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A300%2Ctext%3AVice%2520President%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3ACOMPANY_HEADCOUNT%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3AH%2Ctext%3A5001-10%252C000%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3AI%2Ctext%3A10%252C000%252B%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3AREGION%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A101165590%2Ctext%3AUnited%2520Kingdom%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A101282230%2Ctext%3AGermany%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A103350119%2Ctext%3AItaly%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3AYEARS_IN_CURRENT_POSITION%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A3%2Ctext%3A3%2520to%25205%2520years%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A4%2Ctext%3A6%2520to%252010%2520years%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A5%2Ctext%3AMore%2520than%252010%2520years%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3ACOMPANY_TYPE%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3AC%2Ctext%3APublic%2520Company%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3AP%2Ctext%3APrivately%2520Held%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3APROFILE_LANGUAGE%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3Aen%2Ctext%3AEnglish%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3AYEARS_OF_EXPERIENCE%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A5%2Ctext%3AMore%2520than%252010%2520years%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3AYEARS_AT_CURRENT_COMPANY%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A3%2Ctext%3A3%2520to%25205%2520years%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A4%2Ctext%3A6%2520to%252010%2520years%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A5%2Ctext%3AMore%2520than%252010%2520years%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED))))%2Ckeywords%3A%25E2%2580%259Ctransformation%25E2%2580%259D%2520AND%2520%25E2%2580%259Ccollaboration%25E2%2580%259D%2520AND%2520%2522innovation%2522)&sessionId=jTMWFDW0SXqvrn2MYcpFVA%3D%3D&viewAllFilters=true,2025-08-22T11:50:35.213Z,https://linkedin.com/in/miles-horca-04915213,609410745,Georgina Glas,Category B,"This profile was selected for its expertise in leadership, business transformation, and collaboration within a decentralized culture, making it a perfect fit for the event's focus on Leadership & Teamwork for Intrapreneurship & Transformation.

With more than 20 years of experience in Supply Chain, I have held operational, consultancy, project (including transformation), and capability roles across Planning and Customer Service/Operations.

I thrive when I can challenge the status quo and there is space for creativity; or there is a complex problem,  with a data story to tell, because breaking it down into a simple narrative can influence, mobilise, and create such an impact.

And I have not doubt....I learn everyday.




While building expertise in these two areas, the pivotal moments in my career have been when I addressed tensions between teams and functions, with deep understanding of needs, conflicting priorities and win-win mentality. In such ecosystems we operate in, I bring balance by addressing complex problems, create data stories to support them, and decompose into simple narratives to influence and mobilise. I am continuously recognised as someone that breaks down that complexity, navigates strategy and tactics as needed, and feel equally comfortable leading topics that increase the digital blueprint (e.g. Machine Learning, Decision Automation, Data) or topics that focus on people (e.g. Change Leadership, Storytelling to Influence, Coaching).",,Manufacturing,"london, england, united kingdom","London Area, United Kingdom",5 years 1 month in role,16 years 2 months in company,Unilever,https://www.linkedin.com/company/1248,Planning Internal Consultant & Transformation Manager,01/2016-07/2020,4 years 6 months,2nd,https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E03AQHcARHt6iGgmg/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1677585588272?e=1758758400&v=beta&t=89ZLtph256yTJxZO3TsWeWb3wavxHO9n5b1HQAHoLKs,0,Paulina Ferrer,ACwAABGHs8ABj0uwswzxaoisNoHy0iY9Xb6sSPQ,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACwAABGHs8ABj0uwswzxaoisNoHy0iY9Xb6sSPQ/,False,False,https://www.linkedin.com/sales/search/people?query=(spellCorrectionEnabled%3Atrue%2CrecentSearchParam%3A(id%3A3891166073%2CdoLogHistory%3Atrue)%2Cfilters%3AList((type%3ASENIORITY_LEVEL%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A120%2Ctext%3ASenior%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A220%2Ctext%3ADirector%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A300%2Ctext%3AVice%2520President%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3ACOMPANY_HEADCOUNT%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3AH%2Ctext%3A5001-10%252C000%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3AI%2Ctext%3A10%252C000%252B%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3AREGION%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A101165590%2Ctext%3AUnited%2520Kingdom%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A101282230%2Ctext%3AGermany%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A103350119%2Ctext%3AItaly%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3AYEARS_IN_CURRENT_POSITION%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A3%2Ctext%3A3%2520to%25205%2520years%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A4%2Ctext%3A6%2520to%252010%2520years%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A5%2Ctext%3AMore%2520than%252010%2520years%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3ACOMPANY_TYPE%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3AC%2Ctext%3APublic%2520Company%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3AP%2Ctext%3APrivately%2520Held%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3APROFILE_LANGUAGE%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3Aen%2Ctext%3AEnglish%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3AYEARS_OF_EXPERIENCE%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A5%2Ctext%3AMore%2520than%252010%2520years%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3AYEARS_AT_CURRENT_COMPANY%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A3%2Ctext%3A3%2520to%25205%2520years%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A4%2Ctext%3A6%2520to%252010%2520years%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)%2C(id%3A5%2Ctext%3AMore%2520than%252010%2520years%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED))))%2Ckeywords%3A%25E2%2580%259Ctransformation%25E2%2580%259D%2520AND%2520%25E2%2580%259Ccollaboration%25E2%2580%259D%2520AND%2520%2522innovation%2522)&sessionId=jTMWFDW0SXqvrn2MYcpFVA%3D%3D&viewAllFilters=true,2025-08-22T11:53:42.332Z,https://linkedin.com/in/paulina-ferrer-3145b482,609410745,Georgina Glas,Category A,"This profile was selected for its extensive experience in Supply Chain Operations and demonstrated ability to collaborate and drive growth through innovation, aligning with the event's focus on Leadership & Teamwork for Intrapreneurship & Transformation.

With over 25 years of NHS experience—including senior clinical and operational leadership roles—I bring a grounded, system-level perspective to healthcare innovation. My career spans both public and private sectors, with hands-on involvement in start-ups, digital health product development, commercial strategy, and performance transformation.

I work at the intersection of clinical insight, product design, and commercial execution—helping teams develop solutions that are not only clinically credible but strategically sound and operationally viable. My experience includes user-centred design and human factors training, which I apply pragmatically to support the development of intuitive, safe, and scalable health technologies.

I’m particularly skilled at identifying gaps between clinical need and product reality, shaping strategy, and aligning multidisciplinary teams around shared objectives. Whether it’s defining value propositions, refining go-to-market approaches, or bridging the communication gap between clinicians and product teams, I bring clarity and momentum to complex problems.

Open to collaboration where health, technology, and business strategy intersect.
